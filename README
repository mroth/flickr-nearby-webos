Quick and dirty webos hack to open a browser window to the mobile Flickr Nearby page, using location services to determine the correct location.

A workaround until Palm does the right thing and supports the W3C Geolocation API in the webkit browser, so m.flickr.com will support it natively.

------
Install Palm SDK

git clone [url]
cd flickr-nearby-webos
palm-package src
palm-install com.flickr.nearby*.ipk
